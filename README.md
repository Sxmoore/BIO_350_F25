IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- This first assignment involves making a difference equation to track changes over a period of time. In this case, it projects the quantity of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is produced each subsequent decade over a series of time steps. The equation contains variables that represent different aspects of this specific ecological study. "N" stands for the initial amount of CO2 measured at the beginning of the study. "t" stands for the length of time (in years) that increases by whole numbers. When first running the projection, the input value of "t" is 0. "p" indicates the rate of change in CO2 quantity each year. This variable is called the parameter, and it remains constant through the projection.

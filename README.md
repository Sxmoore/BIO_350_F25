# BIO_350_F25

Starting our BIO350 assignments repo

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- This first assignment involves making a difference equation to track changes over a period of time. In this case, it projects the quantity of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is produced each subsequent decade over a series of time steps. The equation contains variables that represent different aspects of this specific ecological study. "N" stands for the initial amount of CO2 measured at the beginning of the study. "t" stands for the length of time (in years) that increases by whole numbers. When first running the projection, the input value of "t" is 0. "p" indicates the rate of change in CO2 quantity each year. This variable is called the parameter, and it remains constant through the projection.
- Technical difficulties, SHOULD be better from now on
- It works!

IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
- Making an exponential equation to measue how quickly duckweed covers a pond
- Minimal technical difficulties, bit better
- Works and introduced matplot lib, and plotting on x and y axis

IC Assignment 3: Chapter 3 of Ecology Handbook
- Today we made a logistic growth model accounting for intraspecific compatition with self-shading effect.
- Little to no technical difficulties
- Like last week, we used matplot lib and x and y axis plotting to represent the logistic growth model.
- When I heard we would be navigating though this problem by ourselves, I was slightly nervous. I wasn't sure how I would navigate the interface given the little experience I had with it. Thankfully, I was able to guide myself thorugh everything tnaks to a trial-and-error approach. I even found it quite fun slowly understanding everything and reaching the result I was looking for. Can't wait to see what we do next!

IC Example 2:
- used equations for population data to graph plots with matplotlib
- downloades data file with pandas and applied it with python
- learned how to use copilot to edit within lines
- It works!
